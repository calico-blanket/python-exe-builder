# Python EXE Builder

A tool that converts Python scripts to Windows executable files (.exe) with simple operations.

## Features

- **Easy Operation**: Convert Python scripts to .exe files just by following guided prompts
- **Automatic Environment Setup**: Automatically sets up a Python virtual environment
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically installs specified libraries in the virtual environment (note: libraries must be manually identified)
- **Customization Options**:
  - Icon customization
  - Single file/Folder format selection
  - Hidden console window
- **PyInstaller Utilization**: Uses reliable PyInstaller for conversion

## Requirements

- Windows OS
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download as ZIP
2. Double-click `python-exe-builder.bat` to run
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter information:
   - Project name (name of the output executable file)
   - Path of the Python file to convert
   - Required additional libraries (space-separated)
   - Whether to change the icon
   - Output format (single file or folder structure)

### Icon Customization

To use a custom icon:
1. Rename your desired icon file to "icon.ico"
2. Place it in the same directory as the batch file
3. Select "y" at the "Do you want to change the icon?" prompt during conversion

## Output Results

After conversion, the executable file will be generated in the following location:

- **For single file format**: `[Project name]/dist/[Project name].exe`
- **For folder format**: `[Project name]/dist/[Project name]/[Project name].exe`

## Notes

- Single file format: Can be distributed with just a single .exe file
- Folder format: Need to distribute the entire generated folder (larger size but faster startup)
- A properly functioning executable file will be generated by accurately specifying all dependencies

## Identifying Dependencies

This tool cannot automatically detect necessary libraries. You need to identify the dependent libraries used by your Python script in advance.

Recommended tools for identifying dependencies:

1. **pipreqs**: Extracts dependencies from your project
   - https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs

2. **pip-tools**: A set of tools to manage package dependencies
   - https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools 

3. **dependency-extractor**: A tool for extracting dependent libraries from Python scripts
